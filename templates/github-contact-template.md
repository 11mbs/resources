## a template to contact projects on github
This might be useful for other platforms, such as hackaday.io, gitlab, wikifactory, etc.




Hello!

I'm reaching out because we would love to have this project listed on [Open Neuroscience](<https://open-neuroscience.com>), and also share information about it:

Open Neuroscience is a community run project, where we are curating and highlighting open source projects related to neurosciences!

Briefly, we have a website where short descriptions about projects are listed, with links to the projects themselves, their authors, together with images and other links. 

Once a new entry is made, we make a quick check for spam, and publish it. 

Once published, we make people aware of the new entry by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openneurosci), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@open_neuroscience)  and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-neuroscience)

**To add information about their project, developers only need to fill out this [form](https://forms.office.com/e/5QtUtMc3hw)**


In the form, people can add subfields and tags to their entries, so that projects are filterable and searchable on the website!

The reason why we have the form system is that it makes it open for everyone to contribute to the website and allows developers themselves to describe their projects! 

Also, there are so many amazing projects coming out in Neurosciences that it would be impossible for us to keep track and log them all!


Open Neuroscience tech stack leverages open source tools as much as possible:
- The website is based on HUGO + Academic Theme
- Everything is hosted on github [here](https://github.com/open-neuroscience)
- We use [plausible.io](https://[plausible.io) to see visit stats on the website. It respects visitors privacy, doesn't install cookies on your computer
  - You can check our visitor stats [here](https://plausible.io/open-neuroscience.com)

Please [get in touch](mailto:info@open-neuroscience.com) if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
