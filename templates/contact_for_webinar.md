## a template to contact developers to give a talk about their project

We [Open Neuroscience](<https://open-neuroscience.com/>) are reaching out because we would love to have your project featured on a new Seminar series we are organizing in collaboration with [World Wide Science](https://www.world-wide.org/).

Open Neuroscience is a community-run project, where we are curating and highlighting open source projects related to neurosciences!

The goal of this seminar series is to highlight projects that are listed in our website (LINK to the project on our page) and allow developers to show their projects and get feedback from the community.

If you would like to participate and give a talk about your project please let us know of some available dates that fit your schedule.

We will then organize the seminar and announce it using the newly created domain for Open Source at the World [Wide Science platform](https://www.world-wide.org/Open-Source/) and on social media through the Open Neuroscience and World Wide Science twitter accounts.


The format for the seminar is really flexible, and we are initially suggesting a 30-45 min talk, followed up by questions from the audience. In total, we are aiming to have a 60-min session.

We are looking forward to your reply and to attending an amazing seminar about your project.

Best regards,
XXXXX on behalf of the Open Neuroscience team
