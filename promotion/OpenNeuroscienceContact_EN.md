## a template to introduce colleagues, institutions, societies, forums, mailing lists to the project

Dear (change as appropriate),

I would like to introduce you to [Open Neuroscience](<https://open-neuroscience.com>), a database of open source projects, which you will surely find beneficial for your work. Please consider posting this message and attached flyer to your members.

Open Neuroscience is a community run website that curates open source projects related to neurosciences. The website lists short descriptions of the projects which link to their own sites and authors. Descriptions include images, other links, tags and subfields that make them filterable and searchable.

To add project(s), users or developers only need to fill out and submit this short [form](https://forms.gle/ByM8thAhZJkHBMQN8). New entries are published on the site and announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openneurosci) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenNeuroscience). The form system makes contribution open for everyone and also gives developers the opportunity to describe their projects themselves. Additionally, Open Neuroscienceâ€™s tech stack leverages open source tools as much as possible.

I encourage you to forward this message and to use the flyer attached to advocate for open neuroscience in social media, presentations and lectures. [Contact us](mailto:openeuroscience@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
